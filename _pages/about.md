### Professional Experience
#### Distributed Storage Engineer | JD.com (Jul 2024 - Present)
**Team**: Core Storage Platform Department  
Responsible for designing and optimizing JD's flagship distributed storage platform, supporting object storage and image storage services that power JD's e-commerce, logistics, and marketing ecosystems (serving 100M+ daily active users).

- Led the development of a high-throughput image storage service for product detail pages and marketing campaigns, supporting **100M+ daily uploads/downloads** with 99.99% service availability.
- Optimized object storage metadata consistency based on the Raft protocol, reducing replication latency by 30% (from 150ms to 105ms) and lowering cross-region bandwidth consumption by 40%.
- Designed and implemented a distributed cache layer using Redis Cluster for hot image data, improving access performance by 400% (from 200ms to 40ms) and reducing origin server load by 60%.
- Executed cloud-native migration of legacy storage systems, leveraging Kubernetes for orchestration and dynamic resource scaling, cutting off-peak resource waste by 25%.
- Built end-to-end monitoring and alerting systems with Prometheus and Grafana, enabling real-time fault detection and reducing mean time to resolve (MTTR) by 50%.
- Implemented tiered storage strategy (hot data in SSD, cold data in HDD) and intelligent prefetching algorithms, reducing overall storage costs by 15% while maintaining SLA commitments.

#### Backend Development Intern | Kuaishou (Jul 2023 - 2024)
**Team**: Cloud-Native Application - Basic Platform Department  
Focused on cloud-native platform development and observability solution building, enhancing system visibility, scalability, and operational efficiency for Kuaishou's core infrastructure.

- Designed and developed a **unified log monitoring SDK** to standardize observability practices across server and client-side systems, integrating logging, monitoring, and distributed tracing into a single workflow.
- Built a pluggable architecture (via plugin factory pattern) enabling non-intrusive extension of observability capabilities, with seamless integration of local and remote configuration management.
- Integrated **OpenTelemetry** for end-to-end distributed tracing, implementing trace ID generation and flexible exporter components to connect tracing data with logging/monitoring pipelines.
- Developed custom plugins (including internal framework adapters and Prometheus exporters) to enable business-specific metrics collection, alerting, and visualization.
- Optimized cloud-native platform performance by introducing multi-level caching and message queues, reducing database load by 40% for change management modules.
- Designed Elasticsearch indexes and data retrieval scripts for deployment metrics, improving query performance by 35% and enabling efficient platform observability.
- Implemented refined resource management and approval workflows, reducing production environment resource consumption by 25% through intelligent allocation.
